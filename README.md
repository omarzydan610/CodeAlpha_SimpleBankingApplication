# CodeAlpha_SimpleBankingApplication

Task 2 in my CodeAlpha JavaProgramming intership at codeAlpha.

Task is to develop a bank system has the following operations deposits, withdrawals,checking balances, and exiting the program.

I included ANSI escape codes to print colored text in terminal to make it more clear and colorful.

I add delay after operations to make it more like real.
